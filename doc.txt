//----  MIDDLEWARE  ---  ///
Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req),the response object (res),
and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. 
 The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next.

Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:

Execute any code.
Make changes to the request and the response objects.
End the request-response cycle.
Call the next middleware function in the stack.

If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call next() 
to pass control to the next middleware function. Otherwise, the request will be left hanging.

USES :-Application-level middleware
Router-level middleware
Error-handling middleware
Built-in middleware
Third-party middleware
